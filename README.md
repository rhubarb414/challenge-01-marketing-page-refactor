# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

# <Horiseon landing page refactor>

## Description

This project is an update to the Horiseon SEO Marketing webpage with changes made to make it more accessible.

The following acceptance criteria were considered in this refactor:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

After these conditions were satisfied, I also made a pass at double-checking links and cleaning up the CSS, per the "scout rule" of coding.

During the course of this work, I learned more about semantic html elements and uncovered weakpoints in my knowledge, such as where and how a hero-image should be placed in the html structure. It also gained me more experience reading code in order to better understand and manipulate it.
